### 1. Ganesh Chaturthi 2025
Collaborated with the Cultural Club of Institute of Public Enterprise (IPE) and raised funds for the Ganesh Chaturthi. As the Senior Class Representative (SCR) of PGDM - equivalent to MBA Section-B, lead a team though which we raised a maximum amount of <code>Rs. 10687</code> in the college and which was <code>approx. 2x more </code> than the one which raised the second highest amount. Even most students contributed from our section only showing true meaning of cultural spirit and unity.
